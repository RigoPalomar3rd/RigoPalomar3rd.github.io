   <li>Define the Problem</li> 
    <p>This step involves gathering the requirements of the program needed to solve the peoblem.</p>
      <p>Questions that should me answered:</p>
     <nl>
     <li>a. What data do we need to process?</li> 
     <li>b. How should we process the data?</li> 
      <li>c. What output should the program deliver?</li>
      <li>d. How should the user interface look?</li>
      </nl>
      <li>Design the Program</li>
      <p>Program design focuses on vreaking down the program into smaller, more manageable components. Various tools are used to help design a program.</p>
      <p>Commonly used tools:</p>
      <nl>
      <li>Structure Charts</li>
      <li>Algorithm</li>
      <li>Flow Charts</li>
      <li>Decision Tables</li>
          <li>Pseduocode</li>
      </nl>
      <li>Code the Program</li>
    <p>Once the program has been designed, a developer then writes the code.</p>
    <p>Coding often involves translating the design from charts and pseduocode into a specific programming language. Usually the language is chosen during the "defining" stage.</p>

      <li>Documentation</li>
    
      
      <li>Deploying and Maintaining the Program</li>
